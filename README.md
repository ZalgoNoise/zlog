### Overview 


This project started (like many others) as a means for me to learn and understand how logging works (in Go and in general).

Basing myself off of the standard library `log` package, the goal was to create a new, _minimalist_ logger while introducing great features found in open-source projects like [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus).

Very quickly it became apparent that this project had little or no minimalism as it grew over time.

That being the case, the goal morphed from simplicity to feature-rich **and** developer-friendly at the same time -- using abstractions and wrappers to allow more complex configuration or behavior if the dev wants, while (trying to) keep it simple when using simple or default configurations.
